# Ethereum Watchtower

Watchtower that defends against private key theft by frontrunning unauthorized transactions and transferring all user assets to a secure, pre-specified backup address. 

## Background
The immutability of transactions & lack of recourse in the event of a personal wallet hack has led to poor UX for crypto users. As recent events have shown, private keys can be stolen via highly-targeted hacks or [security flaws in wallet infrastructure](https://decrypt.co/106680/solana-hack-blamed-slope-mobile-wallet-exploit). Ethereum Watchtower is intended to be the first-iteration towards mechanisms that mitigate the effects of private key theft.
